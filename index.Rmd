## What is Moore's Law?

1. Computer processors become twice as fast every 18 months.
2. _The number of transistors we cab fit on a processor chip doubles every 18 months._
3. Bandwidth on the interenet doubles every 18 months.
4. The number of users on the internet doubles every 18 months.

*** .hint
Gordon Moore is a co-founder of Intel, which makes processors.

*** .explanation
Moore's law is commonly misunderstood to apply to the speed of computers, which is technically incorrect (althought it captures the sense of his principle).

The cost of data processing, communications, and storage is essentially zero.

*** =pnotes
When I came to USM, we were using groupwise and not gmail.
How much space is on the maine.edu gmail drives? 30Gb and keeps going up
Why are we still doing this?

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis'}
require(rCharts)
years <- c('1983', '1985', '1988', '1997', '2002', '2005', '2015')
cost <- c(3923, 902.95, 314.50, 17.45, 0.97, 0.05, 0.01)
transistors <- data.frame(year = years, cost = cost)
m1 <- mPlot(x = "year", y = "cost", type = "line", data = transistors)
m1$set(pointSize = 0, lineWidth = 1)
m1$print('chart1')
